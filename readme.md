  If you want to Reproduce our code, you can use the requirements.txt to download all the dependencies of this project, and a copy of our code, that could be all.

### Requirements and setup of Brane
  First, we follow two instuction to set up and use Brane. One is Brane user guid: https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide, the other is Brane admin guid: https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/admins.
  We choose the deploy Brane locally, beacause when we are trying to deploy Brane distributed, sometimes the Brane will raise some strange problem even you run same code in same environment that you have successed before.
  We build Brane in our own Virtual Machine, and the base image is Ubuntu 20.04.
  
  #### We have put our Brane code in file 'Brane_code'.

We also creat a DOI for our project on Zenodo, which can be seen in the release section of this  Repository.
